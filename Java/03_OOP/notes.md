# 📅 Day 3 - Java OOP Concepts & Coding Assignments 
16-07-2025

## ✅ Topics Covered:

### 🔹 Types of Inheritance
- **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from another.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: Class B inherits Class A, and Class C inherits Class B.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
- ⚠️ *Note*: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance with classes (only through interfaces).

### 🔹 4 Pillars of OOP in Java
1. **Inheritance** – Acquiring properties from parent class using `extends`.
2. **Polymorphism**
   - Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism)
   - Method Overriding (run-time polymorphism)
3. **Encapsulation** – Wrapping data and methods in one class; use of `private` access modifier and getter/setters.
4. **Abstraction** – Hiding internal implementation using `abstract` classes or `interfaces`.

### 🔹 Abstract Class
- A class declared using the `abstract` keyword.
- Cannot be instantiated directly.
- Can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.

### 🔹 Interface (Just Introduced, Detailed Tomorrow)
- Pure abstraction.
- Uses `implements` keyword.
