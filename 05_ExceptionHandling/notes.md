üõ°Ô∏è Exception Handling Mechanisms
try-catch block
Used to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.

java
Copy code
try {
    // Risky code
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Exception handler
}
throws keyword
Declares that a method may throw an exception.

java
Copy code
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    // code that might throw IOException
}
throw keyword
Used to throw an exception manually.

java
Copy code
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
