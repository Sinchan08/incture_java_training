Day 6: Java Multithreading
19-7-2025

1. Introduction to Multitasking

Multitasking is the process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously.

Two types:

Process-based Multitasking: Each task is a separate process (e.g., opening browser + playing music).

Thread-based Multitasking: Each task is a separate thread within a process (e.g., multiple tabs running in a browser).

2. Thread in Java

Java supports thread-based multitasking using:

Thread class (by extending it)

Runnable interface (by implementing it)

‚úÖ Creating Thread - Two Ways

(a) Extending Thread Class:
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}
(b) Implementing Runnable Interface:
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running...");
    }
}
3. start() vs run()

start() method:

Allocates new call stack and invokes run() internally.

Starts new thread.

run() method:

Executes in current thread (no new thread created).

4. Thread Lifecycle (States)

New: Thread is created.

Runnable: After start() is called.

Running: The thread scheduler picks it to run.

Blocked/Waiting: Thread is waiting for some resource or action.

Terminated: Thread completes execution or is stopped.

5. Thread Priority

Thread class has 3 constants:

Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1

Thread.NORM_PR``IORITY = 5 (default)

Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10

Set using setPriority(int) and get using getPriority().

Scheduler may prefer high-priority threads (but not guaranteed).

6. Thread Methods

‚úÖ yield()

Static method.

Causes current thread to pause and give chance to equal priority threads.

‚úÖ sleep(ms)

Causes thread to sleep for given milliseconds.

Throws InterruptedException.

‚úÖ join()

Waits for another thread to finish before continuing execution.

thread1.join(); // Waits for thread1 to finish

üîÅ Summary

Concept

Purpose

Thread

Allows multitasking in Java

start()

Starts a new thread

run()

Contains thread logic

sleep()

Pauses thread temporarily

yield()

Gives up CPU to other threads

join()

Waits for thread to finish

Priority

Influences thread scheduling
